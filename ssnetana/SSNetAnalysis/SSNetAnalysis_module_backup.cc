/**
 * @file   SSNetAnalysis_module.cc
 * @brief  A basic "skeleton" to read in art::Event records from a file,
 *         access their information, and do something with them. 
 * @author William Seligman (seligman@nevis.columbia.edu)
 * 
 * See
 * <https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/larsoftsvn/wiki/Using_the_Framework>
 * for a description of the ART classes used here.
 *
 * Almost everything you see in the code below may have to be changed
 * by you to suit your task. The example task is to make histograms
 * and n-tuples related to @f$ dE/dx @f$ of particle tracks in the detector.
 *
 * As you try to understand why things are done a certain way in this
 * example ("What's all this stuff about 'auto const&'?"), it will help
 * to read ADDITIONAL_NOTES.txt in the same directory as this file.
 *
 * Also note that, despite our efforts, the documentation and the practices in
 * this code may fall out of date. In doubt, ask!
 * The last revision of this code was done on July 2016 with LArSoft v05_14_00.

   * @brief Example analyser
   * 
   * This class extracts information from the generated and reconstructed
   * particles.
   * It produces histograms for the simulated particles in the input file:
   * - PDG ID (flavour) of all particles
   * - momentum of the primary particles selected to have a specific PDG ID
   * - length of the selected particle trajectory
   * 
   * If also produces two ROOT trees.
   * The first ROOT tree contains information on the simulated particles,
   * including in "dEdx" a binned histogram of collected charge as function
   * of track range.
   * 
   * The second ROOT tree contains information on the reconstructed hits.
   * 
   * Configuration parameters
   * =========================
   * 
   * - *SimulationLabel* (string, default: "largeant"): tag of the input data
   *   product with the detector simulation information (typically an instance
   *   of LArG4 module)
   * - *HitLabel* (string, mandatory): tag of the input data product with
   *   reconstructed hits
   * - *ClusterLabel* (string, mandatory): tag of the input data product with
   *   reconstructed clusters
   * - *PDGcode* (integer, mandatory): particle type (PDG ID) to be selected;
   *   only primary particles of this type will be considered
   * - *BinSize* (real, mandatory): @f$ dx @f$ [cm] used for the @f$ dE/dx @f$
   *   calculation

    // - A range-based for loop operates on a
    // container. particleHandle is not a container; it's a pointer to
    // a container. If we want C++ to "see" a container, we have to
    // dereference the pointer, like this: *particleHandle.

    // - The loop variable that is set to each object in the container
    // is named "particle". As for the loop variable's type:

    //   - To save a little bit of typing and to make the code easier
    //   to maintain, and paying in readability, we're going to let
    //   the C++ compiler deduce the type of what's in the container
    //   (simb::MCParticle objects in this case), so we use "auto".

    //   - We do _not_ want to change the contents of the container,
    //   so we use the "const" keyword to make sure.

    //   - We don't need to copy each object from the container into
    //   the variable "particle". It's sufficient to refer to the
    //   object by its address. So we use the reference operator "&"
    //   to tell the compiler to just copy the address, not the entire
    //   object.

    // It sounds complicated, but the end result is that we loop over
    // the list of particles in the art::Event in the most efficient
    // way possible.

    // <https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/larsoftsvn/wiki/Use_Associations>

    // The web page may a bit difficult to understand (at least, it is
    // for me), so let's try to simplify things:

    // - If you're doing an analysis task, you don't have to worry
    // about creating art::Assns objects. 

    // - You don't have to read the art:Assns objects on your
    // own. There are helper classes (FindXXX) which will do that for
    // you.

    // - There's only one helper you need: art::FindManyP. It will do
    // what you want with a minimum of fuss.

    // - Associations are symmetric. If you see an
    // art::Assns<ClassA,ClassB>, the helper classes will find all of
    // ClassA associated with ClassB or all of ClassB associated with
    // ClassA.

    // - To know what associations exist, you have to be a 'code
    // detective'. The important clue is to look for a 'produces' line
    // in the code that writes objects to an art::Event. For example,
    // in ${LARSIM_DIR}/source/LArG4/LArG4_module.cc, you'll see this
    // line:

    // produces< art::Assns<simb::MCTruth, simb::MCParticle> >();

    // That means a simulated event will have an association between
    // simb::MCTruth (the primary particle produced by the event
    // generator) and the simb::MCParticle objects (the secondary
    // particles produced in the detector simulation).

    // Let's try it. The following statement will find the
    // sim::MCTruth objects associated with the simb::MCParticle
    // objects in the event (referenced by particleHandle):

    const art::FindManyP<simb::MCTruth> findManyTruth(particleHandle, event, fSimulationProducerLabel);

    // Note that we still have to supply the module label of the step
    // that created the association. Also note that we did not have to
    // explicitly read in the simb::MCTruth objects from the
    // art::Event object 'event'; FindManyP did that for us.
    
    // Also note that at this point art::FindManyP has already found all the
    // simb::MCTruth associated with each of the particles in particleHandle.
    // This is a slow process, so in general you want to do it only once.
    // If we had a loop on the particles, we would still do this outside that loop.

    // Now we can query the 'findManyTruth' object to access the
    // information. First, check that there wasn't some kind of error:

    if ( findManyTruth.isValid() )
      {
	// I'm going to be lazy, and just look at the simb::MCTruth
