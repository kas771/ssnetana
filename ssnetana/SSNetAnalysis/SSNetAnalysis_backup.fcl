# A script to run an analysis module: SSNetAnalysis. You may want to
# compare this script with ${LARSIM_DIR}/job/prodsingle.fcl; in
# particular, in this script there are no output streams because the
# module doesn't write any events, just histograms or n-tuples.

# See <https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/larsoftsvn/wiki/Running_Jobs> for 
# more information on the structure of .fcl files. 

# The following line will have to be changed to match your experiment;
# e.g., "services_dune.fcl", "services_microboone.fcl".
# Here we pick the relevant services and the FHiCL files with their
# configurations one by one, according to what is directly used in
# SSNetAnalysis plus a bit of knowledge about what each service depends on
#
#include "geometry_argoneut.fcl"
#include "messageservice.fcl"
#include "simulationservices_argoneut.fcl"

process_name: SSNetAnalysis

services:
{
  # Load the service that manages root files for histograms.
  # Any histograms or n-tuples that you create in the program will be
  # written to this file. You can override the file name with the -T
  # option on the command line; e.g.,
  #  lar -c SSNetAnalysis.fcl -T myhistograms.root -s myinput.root

  TFileService:           { fileName: "SSNetAnalysis.root" }

  # This constrols the display in the output of how long each job step
  # takes for each event. A lot of configuration can be added: details at

  # This parameter controls the level of descriptive output from
  # various LArSoft modules. For a list of different message levels,
  # see ${LARDATA_DIR}/job/messageservice.fcl. For most jobs this is
  # set to standard_warning; here it is set to standard_info because I
  # write some LogInfo messages in the analysis module for
  # demonstration purposes.

  #   provides information about the geometry of the detector and the mapping
  #   of TPC channels to the wires.
  #   Needed by SSNetAnalysis module; from larcore/Geometry/geometry_argoneut.fcl .

# The file "myinput.root" is assumed to have been created by a previous LArSoft job.
