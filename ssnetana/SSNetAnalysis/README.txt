This directory is intended to be part of a soup-to-nuts example of how
to run a LArSoft program to perform an analysis task.

For directions on how to set up and compile this example, see the LArSoft wiki:
<https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/larsoft/wiki/_AnalysisExample_>

The example program in package AnalysisExample does the following:

- reads a file of simulated and perhaps partially-reconstructed events;

- creates a few example histograms;

- creates two example n-tuples;

- has a couple of brief examples of how to use associations. 

There are comments (perhaps too many!) in every file to explain what
everything does.

If you want to understand what you're supposed to learn from all this,
read ADDITIONAL_NOTES.txt in this directory.
